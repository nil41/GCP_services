GCP service account:-

-A service account is a special account that can be used by services and applications running on your Google Compute Engine instance to interact with other Google Cloud Platform API and services.

-Applications can use service account credentials to authorize themselves to a set of APIs and perform actions within the permissions granted to the service account and virtual machine instance.

-For example, if you write an application that reads and writes files on Google Cloud Storage, it must first authenticate to the Google Cloud Storage API. You can create a service account and grant the service account access to the Cloud Storage API. Then, you would update your application code to pass the service account credentials to the Cloud Storage API. In this way, your application authenticates seamlessly to the API without embedding any secret keys or user credentials in your instance, image, or application code.

-In addition, you can create firewall rules that allow or deny traffic to and from instances based on the service account that owns the instances.

-An instance can have one service account only.

two types of service accounts-
1. User-managed service accounts         2. Google-managed service accounts
--------------
1. User-managed service accounts:-
-that you explicitly create and the Compute Engine default service account (which is default created in every project).

Compute Engine default service account- [PROJECT_NUMBER]-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com
-Enabled on all instances created by the gcloud command-line tool and the Cloud Platform Console with a specific set of permissions. You can override this by specifying another service account when creating the instance or by explicitly disabling service accounts for the instance.


2. Google-managed service accounts:-
-These service accounts are created and managed by Google and assigned to your project automatically. These accounts represent different Google services and each account has some level of access to your Google Cloud Platform project.

Google APIs service account- Apart from the default service account, all projects enabled with Compute Engine come with a Google APIs service account, identifiable using the email:

[PROJECT_NUMBER]@cloudservices.gserviceaccount.com

-This service account is designed specifically to run internal Google processes on your behalf. The account is owned by Google and is not listed in the Service Accounts section of Cloud Platform Console.
By default, the account is automatically granted the project editor role on the project and is listed in the IAM section of Cloud Platform Console. This service account is only deleted when the project is deleted. However, you can change the roles granted to this account, including revoking all access to your project.
-----------------

-we can set/assgin IAM role to service accounts.
-there are 3 types of accounts:- 1. user 2. group 3. service account
-service account belongs to your applications rather than an individual end user.
-service accounts are for within a project.

-When you create a new Cloud project, Google Cloud Platform automatically creates one Compute Engine service account and one App Engine service account under that project. You can create up to 98 additional service accounts to your project to control access to your resources. (we can create total 100 service accounts into porject)

-for each service accounts we can creates max 10 keys(public private key pair). it is recommended that you should download this keys (private) in JSON format.
 and keep it safe, it is not recoverable.

-Deleting the default App Engine and Compute Engine service accounts will result in the instances no longer having access to resources in the project. Therefore deletion should be done with caution. You must make sure that your critical applications no longer use a service account before deleting it.
