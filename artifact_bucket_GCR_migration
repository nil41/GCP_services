migration of artifact.******.appspot.com buckets between projects.

2 projects test-1 test-2
-------
test-1 have artifact.test-1.appspot.com   that contain php img. also check into its GCR.
test-2 dont have any artifact bucket.
so to create artifact bucket, need to upload any raw image to GCR of test-2.
so to do that,
#gcloud init  -> login to test-2 project

install docker on local machine.
1. create directory, go into that
2. vi Dockerfile    =>    FROM ubuntu:12.04
3. docker build -t my-ubuntu-image .
4. docker tag my-ubuntu-image gcr.io/test-2-179209/my-ubuntu-image
5. gcloud docker -- push gcr.io/test-2-179209/my-ubuntu-image

- you can also create based on regions also, e.g. us.gcr.io hosts your images in the United States

now artifact bucket will be creates in test-2.
you can also check for image in GCR of test-2.

now to move all images from test-1 to test-2

#gsutil cp -r gs://artifacts.test-1-179209.appspot.com/containers/* gs://artifacts.test-2-179209.appspot.com/containers/

so all bucket files are copied from test-1 to test-2.

goto test-2 GCR and see images from test-1 are copied here.

========================
 more commands:-
#sudo gcloud docker -- pull gcr.io/test-2-179209/my-php-image   

#sudo gcloud container images list

#sudo gcloud container images list --repository gcr.io/test-2-179209

If you just want to make all your images readable to the entire world, then the command from this other StackOverflow answer should help: 
gsutil -m acl -r set public-read gs://bucket-name
gsutil -m defacl set public-read gs://bucket-name
